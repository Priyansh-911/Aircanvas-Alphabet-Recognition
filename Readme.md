THIS IS THE REPOSITORY MADE FOR THE MORE ADVANCES THAT I DID TO THE EARLIER PROJECT THAT I MADE CALLED AirCanvas.

The major differences in this project is that it is in a form that is completely deployable using Flask server,
Second I am currently working on making a recognition system such that the program can recognise whatever is written on the canvas.

Initally will try to implement the recognition of Alphabets and Numbers , later will try to further the project into advanced stages.

You can see its working in the video below
